1) minor changes to the build.xml     (adding a build.classpath to specify where to find izpack jar files)

2) changing <installation version="5.0">

3)  wrap the <native> elements with <natives> ... </natives>

4)  adding classname and stage to the registryInstaller listener:

  <listener installer="RegistryInstallerListener"  classname="RegistryInstallerListener" stage="install" uninstaller="RegistryUninstallerListener">

E.g.:

        <condition type="packselection" id="WindowsServicePackIsSelected">
            <packid>WindowsService</packid>
        </condition>
,the <packid> element has been changed to <name> E.g.

        <condition type="packselection" id="WindowsServicePackIsSelected">
            <name>Windows service</name>
        </condition>

6) In userInputSpec.xml
 <panel> requires attribute 'id' (meaning the id of the panel as defined in openesp-install.xml)
Also The panel.order attribute has been removed from the userInputSpec.xml
